# Blog And Portfolio ✨

This repo is my Portfolio which is built using React, Django, and GraphQL.A Portfolio will provide a platform to showcase our blogs and the latest work that we had done

If you want to understand this repo better and use it follow the steps mentioned below

This repo has divided into two branches for making deployment in Heroku from Github
1. [Frontend](#Frontend)
2. [Backend](#Backend)

The First step is to fork the repo and get it in your Github repositories and then clone the repo to your local environment.

And then create Heroku apps for deploying so that you can add your URLs to the code by following the steps mentioned 

## Frontend ⚛️

## Backend

    > `git -b backend --single-branch <remote-repo-url>`

2. Create a virtual environment and Install the pip packages in the requiremets.txt

1. Now finally add build-packs to the apps in Heroku and deploy the respective branches separately by connecting to the Github

    > We can deploy it together as well but I have chosen to deploy separately.
